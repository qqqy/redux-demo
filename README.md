# REDUX-DEMO

## Steps:
- We created the store
- We created the reducer
- We wrapped App in the Provider
- We connected App to redux using the connect function
- We created an action creator function in our reducer file
- We imported it into App
- We passed it into the connect function, inside the mapDispatchToProps object.
- We invoked the connect version (`props.changeProps`) in our App.
- We saw that it changed props.
